summary: "An essay about the lack of engineers nowadays and why we need more of them."

During the last few weeks we've been hiring for different roles at [Wúru](). Hiring is hard, and recently, this difficulty is being fueled by a trend I'm seeing crystal clear. The market is flooded with programmers, but these programmers are not engineers. On top of that, the past year massive layoffs took place, thus, feeding the flood with even more people (most of them not engineers). Inspiration for this lines came from Joel Spolski's book [Smart & Gets Things Done]() and from the concept that finding great developers (engineers) is really, really, hard.

To begin with let’s put forward some numbers I collected during my last recruiting sprint. I hosted 14 interviews, of which 12 had me virtually dismissing the candidate in the first 5 minutes. Even though the candidate was not fit for the task, I had to held at least a 20 minute conversation with them for politeness. And the common ground for all of these dismissals was the lack of ability to maintain a technical conversation.

Given this, we decided to steer clear of those kinds of profiles. As of right now we’re only hiring engineers or students in the last year of engineering careers.

In my opinion  this non engineer candidates (programmers) are a good fit for big companies where the engineering and design are carried out by higher levels in the org chart. Services companies, where a profit is made by mixing senior workers with more junior or operative ones and selling them as a team. And in the third place a rare group of product oriented companies that really don’t care about their delivery quality. At all.

But, why all the fuzz? Why does a product startup need engineers? It’s simple. A great product is not just programming, requires a long term vision and an understanding of the compromise that you can have between executing fast and delivering quality. And bearing that in mind, how to balance everything to achieve a market changing result. Ideal for quantitative thinkers, engineers.

Engineers can think about the problems as a whole and understand the impact of their piece of code in the process it takes part in. Programmers on the other hand, tend to focus solely on the problem they’re solving isolated from the product, producing more integration errors.

On top of that, an engineer are usually challenge-driven and really engage with the product delivering a lot of value in it’s design iterations, whereas, plain programmers tend to be money driven and harder to retain in the team, thus making the hire more difficult to justify.
