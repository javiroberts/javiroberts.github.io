summary: "An essay about the lack of engineers nowadays and why we need more of them."
---

As the title states we are in desperate need for more engineers. And by we I don't mean my current team at WÃºru. No. There, we are mostly engineers (and the ones who are not, were hired because they can think as one).

Inspiration for this essay came when reading Joel Spolsky's book *Smart & Gets Things Done*.

- Smart Gets Things Done
- Engineering is geting things done
  - getting things well done
