# Hello, world!

I'm Javi a Software Engineer from Argentina.

I'm currently working on the startup that I co-founded, **Wilab**. We work on Javascript, Go and Python, we use lots of cutting edge tools and methodologies.

I love trail running ⛰️🏃, skiing ⛷️ and sailing ⛵.

This is an initial post, and here I intend to start documenting, my life and tech experiences.
