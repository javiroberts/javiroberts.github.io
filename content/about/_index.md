# About me

I'm Javier, a Software Engineer from Cordoba, Argentina.

I'm currently working as [Wuru's](https://wuru.ai) CTO. At WÃºru we are building Magic Calendar, a product that reduces operational friction in healthcare with AI. Currently we are near product-market fit. We'll keep iterating the product features until we accomplish it.

My previous experience was founding Wilab, a company that is still operating and run by great friends of mine. There I used to be in charge of tech team, and as we worked with telecom companies I got to learn a lot about infrastructure and how internet is run.

Before Wilab I worked both as a *Software Engineer* and *SRE* and I still can't decide which side of the street I like the most. Luckily my position as a CTO enables me to do a bit of both.

When I'm not working I like trail running, skiing, sailing and photography (mainly landscapes), if I dare you'll be able to find some pieces here.

I invite you to read my blog, where (hopefully) I'll write about tech & business stuff, and if you like it, leave me an email in the address displayed on this website.
